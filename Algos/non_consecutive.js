// Write a function that takes an array of numbers, and returns
// an array of objects where each object contains the number itself and its index.

// A number is non-consecutive if it is NOT exactly 1 greater than the previous element.
// The first element is not considered non-consecutive.

// EXAMPLE
// non_consecutive([1,2,3,4,6,7,8,10])
// returns [
//      { i: 4, n: 6 }, -> because 6 is not exactly 1 greater than 4
//      { i: 7, n: 10}  -> because 10 is not exactly 1 greater than 8
// ]
