// Write a function that partitions an array. What I mean by this, is
// take the right-most index, and re-arrange the elements in the array so that the 
// number was at the right-most index is in a position such that everything
// to the left of it is less than it, and everything to the right of it is
// greater than it, and return the new index of that element

// EXAMPLE: let arr = [9,2,45,3,12]
// partition(arr) returns 3, and arr is now
// [9,2,3,12,45]
function partition(arr = [], left = 0, right = arr.length-1){
    
}
