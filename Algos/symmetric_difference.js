// Write a function that takes 2 arrays as parameters, and returns the symmetric difference.

// The symmetric difference, looking back to the venn diagram, is the elements in the OUTER
// sections, and NOT the intersection.

// Duplicates should only be included once.

// EXAMPLE:
// symmetric_difference([3,1,4,6,3,9], [5,6,1,5,4,8,7]) would return
// [3, 5, 7, 8]
function symmetric_difference(arr1, arr2){
